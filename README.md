# Rekindle

Blog platform built with Next.js, React and Firebase.

## Deployment

(...)

## Dependencies

- Node.js
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) (Authentication, Firestore Database)
- [React Firebase Hooks](https://github.com/csfrequency/react-firebase-hooks)
- [lodash.debounce](https://www.npmjs.com/package/lodash.debounce)
- [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/)
- [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown)
- [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/)

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
